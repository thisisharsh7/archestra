![SSO Providers Overview](/docs/automated_screenshots/platform-single-sign-on_sso-providers-overview.png)

Archestra supports Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication using OpenID Connect (OIDC) and SAML 2.0 providers. Once configured, users can authenticate with their existing identity provider credentials instead of managing separate passwords.

> **Enterprise feature:** Please reach out to sales@archestra.ai for instructions about how to enable the feature.

## How SSO Works

1. Admin configures an SSO provider in **Settings > SSO Providers**
2. SSO buttons appear on the sign-in page for enabled providers
3. Users click the SSO button and authenticate with their identity provider
4. After successful authentication, users are automatically provisioned and logged in

![Sign-in with SSO](/docs/automated_screenshots/platform-single-sign-on_sign-in-with-sso.png)

## Disabling Basic Authentication

Once you have configured SSO providers, you can optionally disable the username/password login form to enforce SSO-only authentication. This is useful for organizations that want to centralize authentication through their identity provider.

To disable basic authentication, set the `ARCHESTRA_AUTH_DISABLE_BASIC_AUTH` environment variable to `true`. See [Deployment - Environment Variables](/platform-deployment#environment-variables) for configuration details.

> **Important:** Ensure at least one SSO provider is configured and working before disabling basic authentication. Otherwise, users (including administrators) will not be able to sign in.

## Disabling User Invitations

For organizations using SSO with automatic user provisioning, you may want to disable the manual invitation system entirely. This hides the invitation UI and blocks invitation API endpoints.

To disable invitations, set the `ARCHESTRA_AUTH_DISABLE_INVITATIONS` environment variable to `true`. See [Deployment - Environment Variables](/platform-deployment#environment-variables) for configuration details.

## Callback URLs

### OIDC Callback URL

All OIDC providers require a callback URL to be configured. The format is:

```
https://your-archestra-domain.com/api/auth/sso/callback/{ProviderId}
```

For local development:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/sso/callback/{ProviderId}
```

The `{ProviderId}` is case-sensitive and must match exactly what you configure in Archestra (e.g., `Okta`, `Google`, `GitHub`, `GitLab`, `EntraID`).

### SAML Callback URL (ACS URL)

For SAML providers, the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL format is:

```
https://your-archestra-domain.com/api/auth/sso/saml2/sp/acs/{ProviderId}
```

For local development:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/sso/saml2/sp/acs/{ProviderId}
```

## Supported Providers

### Okta

Okta is an enterprise identity management platform. To configure Okta SSO:

1. In Okta Admin Console, create a new **Web Application**
2. Set the **Sign-in redirect URI** to your callback URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/sso/callback/Okta`
3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. In Archestra, click **Enable** on the Okta card
5. Enter your Okta domain (e.g., `your-org.okta.com`)
6. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret
7. Click **Create Provider**

**Okta-specific requirements:**

- Disable **DPoP** (Demonstrating Proof of Possession) in your Okta application settings. Archestra does not support DPoP.
- The issuer URL is automatically set to `https://your-domain.okta.com`

### Google

Google OAuth allows users to sign in with their Google accounts.

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create or select a project
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**
4. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (Web application)
5. Add your callback URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/sso/callback/Google`
6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
7. In Archestra, click **Enable** on the Google card
8. Enter your domain and the credentials

**Google-specific notes:**

- Users must have a Google Workspace or personal Google account
- The discovery endpoint is automatically configured

### GitHub

GitHub OAuth allows users to sign in with their GitHub accounts.

4. Copy the **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**
5. In Archestra, click **Enable** on the GitHub card
6. Enter your domain and the credentials

**GitHub limitations:**

- **Users must have a public email** set in their GitHub profile for SSO to work. GitHub's OAuth does not expose private emails through the standard user endpoint.
- To set a public email: Go to [GitHub Profile Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) and select a public email
- PKCE is automatically disabled for GitHub (not supported)

### GitLab

GitLab OAuth allows users to sign in with their GitLab accounts (both GitLab.com and self-hosted instances).

1. Go to [GitLab Applications](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications) (or your self-hosted instance)
2. Click **Add new application**
3. Set the **Redirect URI** to: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/sso/callback/GitLab`
4. Select scopes: `openid`, `email`, `profile`
5. Click **Save application**
6. Copy the **Application ID** (Client ID) and **Secret** (Client Secret)
7. In Archestra, click **Enable** on the GitLab card
8. Enter your domain and the credentials

**GitLab-specific notes:**

- For self-hosted GitLab, update the issuer URL to your GitLab instance (e.g., `https://gitlab.yourcompany.com`)
- GitLab supports OIDC discovery, so endpoints are automatically configured
- See [GitLab OAuth documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/openid_connect_provider.html) for more details

### Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) allows users to sign in with their Microsoft work or school accounts.

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) > **Microsoft Entra ID**
2. Navigate to **App registrations** > **New registration**
3. Enter a name and select supported account types
4. Set the **Redirect URI** to: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/sso/callback/EntraID`
5. After creation, go to **Certificates & secrets** > **New client secret**
6. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Client Secret**
7. Note your **Directory (tenant) ID** from the Overview page
8. In Archestra, click **Enable** on the Microsoft Entra ID card
9. Replace `{tenant-id}` in all URLs with your actual tenant ID
10. Enter your domain and the credentials

**Entra ID-specific notes:**

- The tenant ID is required in all endpoint URLs
- For single-tenant apps, use your specific tenant ID
- For multi-tenant apps, use `common` or `organizations` instead of the tenant ID
- See [Microsoft Entra ID documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc) for more details

### Generic OAuth (OIDC)

For other OIDC-compliant providers not listed above, use the Generic OAuth option.

- **Issuer**: The OIDC issuer URL
- **Domain**: Your organization's domain
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret**: From your identity provider
- **Discovery Endpoint**: The `.well-known/openid-configuration` URL (optional if issuer supports discovery)

Optional configuration:

- **Authorization Endpoint**: Override the discovery endpoint
- **Token Endpoint**: Override the discovery endpoint
- **User Info Endpoint**: Override the discovery endpoint
- **JWKS Endpoint**: For token validation
- **Scopes**: Additional OAuth scopes (default: `openid`, `email`, `profile`)
- **PKCE**: Enable if your provider requires it

#### Using Keycloak as an OIDC Provider

[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) is an open-source identity and access management solution that can be used as an OIDC provider.

1. In Keycloak Admin Console, create a new **Client** with protocol `openid-connect`
2. Set **Client authentication** to `On`
3. Add your callback URL to **Valid redirect URIs**: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/sso/callback/{ProviderId}`
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Credentials tab
5. In Archestra, click **Enable** on the Generic OAuth card
6. Set the **Provider ID** (e.g., `Keycloak`)
7. Set the **Issuer** to: `https://your-keycloak-domain/realms/{realm-name}`
8. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret
9. Click **Create Provider**

### Generic SAML

Archestra supports SAML 2.0 for enterprise identity providers that don't support OIDC.

Required information:

- **Provider ID**: A unique identifier (e.g., `okta-saml`, `adfs`)
- **Issuer**: Your organization's identifier
- **Domain**: Your organization's domain
- **SAML Issuer / Entity ID**: The identity provider's entity ID (from IdP metadata)
- **SSO Entry Point URL**: The IdP's Single Sign-On URL
- **IdP Certificate**: The X.509 certificate from your IdP for signature verification

Optional configuration:

- **IdP Metadata XML**: Full XML metadata document from your IdP (recommended for robust configuration)
- **Callback URL (ACS URL)**: Automatically generated, but can be overridden
- **SP Entity ID**: Service Provider entity ID (defaults to your Archestra domain)
- **SP Metadata XML**: Custom Service Provider metadata

**SAML-specific notes:**

- SAML responses must be signed by the IdP
- The NameID format should be set to `emailAddress` in your IdP
- User attributes (email, firstName, lastName) should be included in the SAML assertion
- See your IdP's documentation for specific configuration steps

#### Using Keycloak as a SAML Provider

1. In Keycloak Admin Console, create a new **Client** with protocol `saml`
2. Set the **Client ID** to your SP Entity ID (e.g., `https://your-archestra-domain.com`)
3. Set **Root URL** to your Archestra domain
4. Add your ACS URL to **Valid redirect URIs**: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/sso/saml2/sp/acs/{ProviderId}`
5. Configure **Client Signature Required** to `Off` (unless you're providing SP signing certificates)
6. Add protocol mappers for `email`, `firstName`, and `lastName` attributes
7. Download the IdP metadata from: `https://your-keycloak-domain/realms/{realm-name}/protocol/saml/descriptor`
8. In Archestra, click **Enable** on the Generic SAML card
9. Set the **Provider ID** (e.g., `KeycloakSAML`)
10. Paste the IdP metadata XML into the **IdP Metadata XML** field
11. Click **Create Provider**

## Role Mapping

Archestra supports automatic role assignment based on user attributes from your identity provider using [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/examples.html) expressions. This allows you to map SSO groups, roles, or other claims to Archestra roles (e.g., Admin, Member, or any custom role you've defined).

### How Role Mapping Works

1. When a user authenticates via SSO, Archestra receives user attributes from the identity provider (via OIDC userinfo/token claims or SAML assertions)
2. These attributes are evaluated against your configured mapping rules in order
3. The first rule that matches determines the user's Archestra role
4. If no rules match, the user is assigned the configured default role (or "Member" if not specified)

### Configuring Role Mapping

When creating or editing an SSO provider, expand the **Role Mapping (Optional)** section:

1. **Data Source**: Choose which SSO data to evaluate:

   - **Combined (Token + UserInfo)**: Merges ID token claims and userinfo (default, recommended)
   - **UserInfo Only**: Only use OIDC userinfo endpoint data
   - **ID Token Only**: Only use ID token claims

2. **Mapping Rules**: Add one or more rules. Each rule has:

   - **JMESPath Expression**: A [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) expression that evaluates to a truthy value when the rule should match
   - **Archestra Role**: The role to assign when the expression matches

3. **Default Role**: The role assigned when no rules match (defaults to "member")

4. **Strict Mode**: When enabled, denies user login if no mapping rules match. This is useful when you want to ensure that only users with specific IdP attributes can access Archestra. Without strict mode, users who don't match any rule are simply assigned the default role.

5. **Skip Role Sync**: When enabled, the user's role is only determined on their first login. Subsequent logins will not update their role, even if their IdP attributes change. This allows administrators to manually adjust roles after initial provisioning without those changes being overwritten on next login.

### JMESPath Expression Examples

JMESPath is a query language for JSON. Here are common patterns:

| Expression                                                          | Description                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `contains(groups \|\| \`[]\`, 'admins')`                            | Match if "admins" is in the groups array    |
| `role == 'administrator'`                                           | Match if role claim equals "administrator"  |
| `roles[?@ == 'platform-admin'] \| [0]`                              | Match if "platform-admin" is in roles array |
| `department == 'IT' && title != null`                               | Match IT department users with a title set  |
| `contains(groups \|\| \`[]\`, 'team-leads') \|\| role == 'manager'` | Match team leads OR managers                |

> **Tip**: Use `|| \`[]\`` when checking arrays to handle null/missing values gracefully.

### Provider-Specific Configuration

#### Okta

Okta can send groups in the ID token. Configure a Groups claim:

1. In Okta Admin Console, go to **Security > API > Authorization Servers**
2. Select your authorization server and go to **Claims**
3. Add a new claim:
   - **Name**: `groups`
   - **Include in token type**: ID Token (Always)
   - **Value type**: Groups
   - **Filter**: Configure to match your groups

Example mapping rule:

```
contains(groups || `[]`, 'Archestra-Admins')
```

#### Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

Entra ID can include group memberships. Configure group claims:

1. In Azure Portal, go to your App Registration
2. Navigate to **Token configuration**
3. Click **Add groups claim**
4. Select the group types to include

Example mapping rule (using group object IDs):

```
contains(groups || `[]`, 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx')
```

Or configure group names in Entra ID's optional claims.

#### Keycloak

Keycloak can send groups via a protocol mapper:

1. In Keycloak Admin Console, go to your Client
2. Navigate to **Client scopes** > your client's dedicated scope
3. Add a mapper:
   - **Mapper type**: Group Membership
   - **Token Claim Name**: `groups`
   - **Full group path**: Off (recommended for simpler matching)
   - **Add to ID token**: Yes
   - **Add to userinfo**: Yes

Example mapping rule:

```
contains(groups || `[]`, 'archestra-admins')
```

#### Generic SAML

For SAML providers, ensure your IdP sends group/role attributes in the SAML assertion. Configure attribute mappers to include these in the assertion, then reference them in your JMESPath expressions.

The attribute names depend on your IdP's configuration. Common examples:

```
contains(groups || `[]`, 'admins')
contains(memberOf || `[]`, 'CN=Admins,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com')
```

### Troubleshooting Role Mapping

**Role not being assigned correctly:**

1. Check your IdP's configuration to ensure the expected claims/attributes are being sent
2. Use your IdP's token introspection or SAML assertion viewer to verify the actual data
3. Ensure your JMESPath expression syntax is correct (test at [jmespath.org](https://jmespath.org/))
4. Rules are evaluated in order - ensure your most specific rules come first

**Missing groups claim:**

- For OIDC: Verify your IdP is configured to include groups in the token/userinfo
- For SAML: Check that group attributes are included in the assertion and properly mapped

**Expression always returns false:**

- Check for typos in claim/attribute names (they are case-sensitive)
- Use the "combined" data source to ensure you're checking both token and userinfo
- Handle null/missing arrays with `|| \`[]\`` fallback

## Team Synchronization

Archestra supports automatic team membership synchronization based on user group memberships from your identity provider. When users log in via SSO, they can be automatically added to or removed from Archestra teams based on their IdP groups.

### How Team Sync Works

1. Admin configures an Archestra team and links it to one or more external IdP groups
2. When a user logs in via SSO, their group memberships are extracted from the SSO token (typically from the `groups` claim)
3. Archestra compares the user's IdP groups against the external groups linked to each team
4. **Added**: Users in a linked group are automatically added to the team
5. **Removed**: Users no longer in any linked group are automatically removed (if they were added via sync)
6. **Manual members preserved**: Members added manually to a team are never removed by sync

### Configuring Team Sync

1. Navigate to **Settings > Teams**
2. Create a team or select an existing team
3. Click the **link icon** (Configure SSO Team Sync) button next to the team
4. In the dialog, enter the external group identifier(s) to link:
   - For OIDC/OAuth: The group name as it appears in the `groups` claim (e.g., `engineering`, `archestra-admins`)
   - For LDAP-style groups: The full DN (e.g., `cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com`)
   - For Azure AD: The group object ID or display name
5. Click **Add** to create the mapping
6. Repeat for additional groups if needed

### Group Identifier Matching

- Group matching is **case-insensitive** (e.g., `Engineering` matches `engineering`)
- The identifier must exactly match what your IdP sends in the token
- A single team can be linked to multiple external groups
- Multiple teams can share the same external group mapping

### Provider-Specific Configuration

#### Keycloak

Ensure your Keycloak client has a groups mapper:

1. In Keycloak Admin Console, go to your Client
2. Navigate to **Client scopes** > your client's dedicated scope
3. Add or configure a **Group Membership** mapper:
   - **Token Claim Name**: `groups`
   - **Full group path**: Off (recommended for simpler matching)
   - **Add to ID token**: Yes
   - **Add to userinfo**: Yes

Users must be assigned to groups in Keycloak for team sync to work.

#### Okta

Configure a Groups claim in your authorization server:

1. Go to **Security > API > Authorization Servers**
2. Select your authorization server and go to **Claims**
3. Add/edit the `groups` claim to include in the ID token

#### Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

Configure group claims in your App Registration:

1. Go to **Token configuration**
2. Add a groups claim
3. Choose whether to include all groups or specific security groups
4. Note: Group Object IDs are returned by default; configure optional claims for group names

#### Generic SAML

For SAML providers, ensure group attributes are included in the SAML assertion. The attribute name must match what you configure as external group identifiers.

### Example: Development Team Setup

Let's say you have a Keycloak group called `dev-team` and want all members to automatically join the "Development" team in Archestra:

1. Ensure Keycloak sends the `groups` claim with group names
2. In Archestra, create a team called "Development"
3. Click the link icon for the team
4. Enter `dev-team` as the external group identifier
5. Click Add

Now, when users with the `dev-team` group log in via SSO, they'll automatically be added to the Development team.

### Troubleshooting Team Sync

**Users not being added to teams:**

1. Verify your IdP is sending the `groups` claim in the SSO token
2. Check that the group identifier in Archestra exactly matches the IdP group name
3. Ensure the enterprise license is activated
4. Check backend logs for sync errors

**Users not being removed from teams:**

- Only members with `syncedFromSso = true` are removed by sync
- Members added manually are never removed
- Verify the user's IdP groups have actually changed

**Checking SSO token groups:**

Use your IdP's token introspection or a JWT decoder to inspect the ID token and verify the `groups` claim contains the expected values.

## User Provisioning

When a user authenticates via SSO for the first time:

1. A new user account is created with their email and name from the identity provider
2. The user's role is determined by role mapping rules (if configured) or defaults to **Member**
3. The user is added to the organization with the determined role
4. A session is created and the user is logged in

Subsequent logins automatically link to the existing account based on email address. Role mapping rules are evaluated on each login, so role changes in the IdP are reflected on next sign-in.

## Account Linking

If a user already has an account (created via email/password), SSO authentication will automatically link to that account when:

- The email addresses match
- The SSO provider is in the trusted providers list (Okta, Google, GitHub, GitLab, Entra ID, and all SAML providers are trusted by default)

## Removing an SSO Provider

To remove a configured SSO provider:

1. Click **Configure** on the provider card
2. Click the **Delete** button
3. Confirm the deletion

Existing users who authenticated via that provider will need to use another authentication method (email/password or another SSO provider).

## Troubleshooting

### "state_mismatch" Error

This typically occurs when cookies are blocked or the callback URL doesn't match. Ensure:

- Third-party cookies are enabled in the browser
- The callback URL in your identity provider exactly matches the Archestra callback URL

### "missing_user_info" Error

The identity provider didn't return required user information. For GitHub, ensure the user has a public email set.

### "account not linked" Error

The SSO provider is not in the trusted providers list. Contact your administrator to add the provider to the trusted list.

### "invalid_dpop_proof" Error (Okta)

DPoP is enabled in your Okta application. Disable it in Okta Admin Console under the application's security settings.

### "account_not_found" Error (SAML)

The SAML assertion didn't contain the required user attributes. Ensure your IdP is configured to send:

- `NameID` in email format (recommended)
- `email` attribute
- `firstName` and `lastName` attributes (optional but recommended)

Check your IdP's protocol mapper configuration.

### "signature_validation_failed" Error (SAML)

The SAML response signature couldn't be verified. Ensure:

- The IdP certificate in Archestra matches the current signing certificate from your IdP
- If using IdP metadata, ensure it's up to date (certificates can expire or rotate)
- Re-download the IdP metadata and update the configuration
